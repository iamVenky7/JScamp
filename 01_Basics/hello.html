    <h2>
      1. Explain the use of JavaScript ( or What you can do using a JavaScript)
      ?
    </h2>
    <p>
      sol: Javascript is used to create dynamic and interactive web content like
      applications and browsers. <br />
      Here are some basic things JavaScript is used for: <br />
      a. Adding interactive behavior to web pages. <br />
      b. JavaScript allows users to interact with web pages. <br />
      c. Creating web and mobile apps. <br />
      d. Building web servers and developing server applications. <br />
      e. Game development.
    </p>

    <h2>2. What is the difference between client-side and server-side?</h2>

    <p>
      Client-side means that the processing takes place on the user’s computer.
      It requires browsers to run the scripts on the client machine without
      involving any processing on the server. Server-side means that the
      processing takes place on a web server.
    </p>
    <h1 style="color: darkred">Client Side <------> Server Side</h1>
    <p>
      This processing is important to execute the tasks required by the user on
      the web. Since the client-side script is executed on the client’s
      computer, it is visible to the client. On the other hand, the server-side
      script is executed in the server; hence, it is not visible to the users.
    </p>
    <h3>Differences between client-side and server-side</h3>
    <div style="display: flex">
      <div>
        <h4>Client-side</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Does not need interaction with the server.</li>
          <li>Runs on the user’s computer .</li>
          <li>Reduces load on the server’s proccessing unit.</li>
          <li>Languages used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>Server-side.</h4>
        <li>Requires interaction with the server.</li>
        <li>Runs on the web server.</li>
        <li>
          Allows the server to provide dynamic websites tailored to the user.
        </li>
        <li>Increases the processing load on server.</li>
        <li>Languages used: PHP, ASP.net, Python.</li>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h3>3. What is Nodejs?</h3>
    <p>
      Node.js is an open-source and cross-platform JavaScript runtime
      environment. It is a popular tool for almost any kind of project!
      <br />
      It runs on various platforms (Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac OS X, etc.)
    </p>

    <h2>4. Explain Scope in JavaScript?</h2>

    <p>
      The current context of execution. The context in which values and
      expressions are "visible" or can be referenced. If a variable or other
      expression is not "in the current scope," then it is unavailable for use.
      Scopes can also be layered in a hierarchy, so that child scopes have
      access to parent scopes, but not vice versa.
    </p>

    <h2>5. JavaScript is asynchronous or synchronous?</h2>
    <p>
      Well, Javascript is Synchronous, It is a synchronous, single-threaded
      language. Because it has a single thread that's why it can only execute
      one command at a time and the other commands need to wait for executing
      before the running command executes. And the term synchronous means one at
      a time.
    </p>

    <h2>6.JavaScript is Single-threaded or Multi-threaded.</h2>
    <p>
      Javascript is a single threaded language. This means
      <strong> it has one call stack and one memory heap.</strong> As expected,
      it executes code in order and must finish executing a piece code before
      moving onto the next. It's synchronous, but at times that can be harmful.
    </p>
    <h2>7. Explain DOM in your own word</h2>
    <p>
      The Document Object Model (DOM)
      <strong>is a programming interface for web documents.</strong> It
      represents the page so that programs can change the document structure,
      style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects;
      that way, programming languages can interact with the page.
